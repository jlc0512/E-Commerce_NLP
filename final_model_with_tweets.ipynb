    "In this project, I am a Data Scientist contractor working with different Women's Fashion Brands, such as Zara and H&M, to classify comments as negative or positive. This project aims to create a generalizable classification model that can be fed comments from any platform, such as Twitter, Instagram, or blogs. For demonstration purposes, I will utilize my model to classify tweets as positive or negative so the customer service teams can respond appropriately, such as responding to customer concerns in negative tweets and retweeting positive tweets."

    "Natural language processing (NLP) has proved to be a highly effective technology for companies to save time and money while optimizing business processes. One of the major benefits of natural language processing for businesses is the ability to process massive volumes of text across various outlets, such as social media platforms, blogs, comments, and so on. By utilizing a machine learning model to classify text as positive or negative, businesses can send the comments to the appropriate teams, such as Quality Assurance for negative comments or Marketing for positive comments. Social media is the second most preferred channel (after an in-person interaction) for customers to initiate communication; for millennials, social media is the most preferred channel. It is important for businesses to respond to these comments in order to protect the brand's reputation, show customers your care, reduce churn, and improve visibility to potential new customer bases and improve customer loyalty for current customers. Generalizability is important with the constant evolution of technology, social media, and how users choose to interact with products and brands. While one brand may receive lots of tweets, another brand may be discussed more in the comments of their Instagram posts."

By utilizing reviews as my source, I am able to easily assign a label of Positive_Rating (0 being false, 1 being true) to the review text based on the rating. This helps my model learn what words are associated with a positive sentiment and what words may be more associated with a negative sentiment. I can then apply this model to texts that are not accompanied by a number rating, such as tweets, Instagram captions, blog posts, and more."

Utilizing the model will allow companies to save time and by flagging the comments for appropriate teams to respond to, such as Quality Assurance to respond to negative comments, or marketing to respond to and promote positive comments. Responding to these comments appropriately will improve products by identifying potential clothing quality issues if the same sentiment is being repeated, identify potential positive trends, boost visability by responding to comments, and improve brand loyalty by making customers feel heard."
